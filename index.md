### Introduction

The Grace2Learn handbook is the central repository for how we run the learning hub. If there are any internal questions regarding Grace2Learn’s operations, please refer to this handbook as the final authority. As part of our value of being transparent the handbook is open to the world, and we welcome feedback.  Currently it’s in Google docs form, the plan is to change it to more accessible format. A website is the most likely medium.

The handbook will be viewed and treated by all as the Single Source of Truth (SSOT). This means that it has the final say on procedures and processes. As a continually evolving organization, the handbook itself will therefore also need to evolve at least at a monthly frequency. This means that if only one person is doing the work that it would be a full-time job. Therefore, we give everyone the responsibility to update the handbook. All changes also need to be communicated in the #handbook Slack channel. The designated leader of the handbook (elected every 3 months), checks all changes made via the changelog on a monthly basis and follows up on anything that is not clear and anything that has not been communicated.
